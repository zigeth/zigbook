The Zigbook documentation syncs the upstream standard library references and groups them by domain for faster discovery.

## Categories

- [Collections & Containers](./collections/) — Data structures, buffer managers, and container abstractions for high-performance Zig code.
- [Algorithms & Numerics](./algorithms/) — Sorting, randomization, math helpers, and SIMD acceleration primitives.
- [Text & Encoding](./encodings/) — Formatting, serialization, and text-processing helpers for structured data.
- [Cryptography & Hashing](./crypto/) — Cryptographic primitives, hashing utilities, and secure random helpers.
- [Core Systems](./systems/) — Low-level concurrency, metaprogramming, memory, and language runtime building blocks.
- [Platform & Runtime](./platform/) — Operating system bindings, filesystem helpers, timers, and IO abstractions.
- [Diagnostics & Observability](./observability/) — Logging, debugging, tracing, and progress reporting utilities.
- [Networking & Protocols](./networking/) — Transport stacks, HTTP client utilities, and URI helpers for networked applications.
- [Toolchain & Binaries](./toolchain/) — Build orchestration, target metadata, dynamic libraries, and binary format tooling.
- [Binary & Archive Formats](./formats/) — Utilities for structured file formats, archives, and semantic versioning.
- [Testing & Quality](./testing/) — Testing harnesses, assertions, and quality-of-life helpers for validation.
